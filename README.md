Designers and Painters are turning to digital tools for thei work, and require collaboration and file management without any compromise on the performance of their work.

Our project WeavCanvas allows artists and designers to seamlessly create stunning paintings and geometrical designs, using our AI canvas and unique brushes.

They can collaborate with others in real time even from different devices, as our projects will be using websockets from socket.io. The project will also allow speech to text and text to speech messaging as they dont wanna type while doing the art, and save it as png.
